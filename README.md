# This is just a little website that I made for my friends who don't game to get into gaming. 
Here are some of the features (it's my first website):
* A home page with a picture of me
* Interactive buttons to other pages
* A "Console vs PC page" where I discuss the strengths and weaknesses of PC gaming copared to Console gaming
* A "Top 5 games page" which is my list of my favorite video games (both PC and console)
